# Cisco Spaces

Team 3 W 2 M

Deployed here

2.4ghz bluetooth communication between sensors -> cloud platform

temperature, sensor data, motion sensors, table occupied or not (!)

-> decisions should be made using that data

firehose api (we can use it)

stream of realtime information
(subscribe to the data)

-<-partners with cisco (check out what they already do)

digital signage = count amount of people /ticketing

## example use case - simon light from uk

chat app -> openai api with heading data

write python for it

eventtype important

x,y,z from the device
only real time data

store info in a db

traditional spaces api data -> historical data

recognize recurring persons

python examples

different devices, different data

ideas is what they need

combine data in a smart way

create something that will be used next year !!

accuracy: 

signal strenght -> approximates location of endclient

5-10m accuracy of endusers 

maximum range?
communication between devices?

#geofencing

eventsite -> cisco -> github repo link
